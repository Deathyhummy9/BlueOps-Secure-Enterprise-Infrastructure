#  BlueOps: Secure Enterprise Infrastructure Lab 

# Overview 
A hands-on, enterprise-level IT infrastructure built entirely in **VirtualBox**.  
It replicates a secure multi-VLAN corporate network, complete with **pfSense firewalling**, **Windows Server Active Directory**, and a **Windows 11 domain workstation**.

🧠 Objectives
- Simulate a realistic enterprise network as a Network / Systems Admin would manage.
- Gain practical skills in VLAN segmentation, firewall configuration, DNS, DHCP, and AD.
- Gain practical skills in Siem and zabbix monitoring
- gain practical skills in Vpn usgae and PowerShell automation
- Prepare for Network+ / CCNA / SysAdmin roles through hands-on experience.

- # 🧱 Phase 1 – Virtualization & Base Network Setup
- Phase 1 lays the foundation for the entire **Secure Enterprise Infrastructure** lab.

In this phase, I:
- Built the virtual environment in **VirtualBox**
- Created internal networks to simulate VLANs
- Deployed core VMs:
  - pfSense firewall
  - Windows Server 2022 (future Domain Controller)
  - Windows client (Windows 11 Pro) for domain join
  - linux mint to configure pfSense on the web gui
